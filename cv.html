    ETL of Static: Within this project the goal was to clean, normalize and move data from an old ec2 instance to a New Data platform. To complete this task we used AWK for the inital transformation and then Pyspark and AWS glue to move that to gold standard. This was then loaded into our data platform with a secondary copy kept in S3 
    <br>
    Implementing RESTful APIS: We are currently implementing various different APIs into an internal tool in order to allow analysts to expedite there work process. In this we use a python function to retrieve data from the API whenever the lambda is called. This data is then passed to our own api where it is transformed into a format suitable for the frontend<br>
