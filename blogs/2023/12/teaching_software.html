            Let me preface this by saying that I really enjoyed teaching. 
            I enjoyed the security of it, the routine, the holidays and the engaging with the students on a topic that I really enjoyed. Why would you change then you’re probably saying? Well my main problem was I didn’t feel I was being intellectually stimulated. 
            Yes I know I sound pretentious but that is my truth. 
            Teaching a topic for the first time I could come up with creative ways to convey the knowledge but after teaching the same class three times in one week that novelty wore off. 
            During my time teaching I found myself engaging with material on Artificial Intelligence during the weekends and even on my summer holidays. So I thought why not give it a bash and get into it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Firstly I enrolled in a part-time program in for a MSc in Software Design and Artificial Intelligence.
           Mainly to keep me stimulated from this I spent my evenings and weekends doing assignments and attending lectures. 
           There was even some lunch breaks that I would spend studying. I did this for about 1 year while teaching, nearly programming or reading on every chance I got. 

        </p>
        <p>
          After about a year of teaching I started applying for jobs, at first machine learning engineer roles but I soon found out I did not have the background to compete with the talent out there considering I only had a relevant masters. Due to this I began applying for roles just outside of the machine learning domain, such as a regular software engineer and data analytics.

        </p>
        <p>
          1 year into my masters I was offered a role as a data & analytics associate.  While this was not the exact role I was searching for I saw it as a stepping stone. I began working as a data analyst while continuing with my masters. Every opportunity I got to talk with someone who was involved with AI I’d take it. Set up calls, send messages and network your way too engaging with everyone within the space. After about a year of work as a data analyst I finally got my first role using my skills in python and machine learning. I absolutely loved it. The work was really interesting and I thought I had finally found what I was searching for. Unfortunately a few things changed within the company and I was beginning to be pulled back towards data analytics. 

        </p>
        <p>
          Simultaneously I was reached out to by another company, for a role adjacent again. A developer. While yes I did think about becoming a developer at one stage or another, I never fully pursued it. Again I saw the move as something to help build skills that would directly translate to the direction I was hoping of moving in. This move was probably one of the most difficult but rewarding. The learning curve was steep and I often felt out of my depth, although I’ve a feeling this won’t change anytime soon or at all.

          <h3>If you are looking to make a similar switch my main points would be: </h3>
          <div class="ul-teaching">
            <ul>
              <li>Try actually writing some code. </li>
              <li> Find something you find interesting and base all your learning off of this. </li>
                <li>If you can do a course, there’s plenty of government funded courses</li>
                <li>Springboard </li>
                <li>Skill Up</li>
                <li>Code Institute</li>
                <li>Find a job that has a technology department or the job you’re looking for</li>
                <li>Network, talk to those people are your company, send them messages ask to shadow</li>
                <li>Show what value you can bring and try and make the move. </li>
            </ul>
