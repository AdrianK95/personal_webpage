            Let me preface this by saying that I really enjoyed teaching. 
            I enjoyed the security of it, the routine, the holidays and the engaging with the students on a topic that I really enjoyed. Why would you change then you’re probably saying? Well my main problem was I didn’t feel I was being intellectually stimulated. 
            Yes I know I sound pretentious but that is my truth. 
            Teaching a topic for the first time I could come up with creative ways to convey the knowledge but after teaching the same class three times in one week that novelty wore off. 
            During my time teaching I found myself engaging with material on Artificial Intelligence during the weekends and even on my summer holidays. So I thought why not give it a bash and get into it.
